# sdpd-Lab1-SampleCal

This is a basic calculator with an addition button. Exceptions are not taken care of in this sample app. The idea behind this sample app is to give just a headstart of what we are expecting from you in the lab.

Problem Statement - In this assignment, you are requested to create an android app that implements an arithmetic calculator. 

1.)It also should save last 5 results in that particular session.

2.)The app should not get crashed at any point in the demo(exceptions should be taken care of).

3.)It should be able to handle negative numbers. Example: 2 + -1 or -1 + 3.

For any doubts, feel free to contact any of us.
